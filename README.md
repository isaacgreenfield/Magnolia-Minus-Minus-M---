Okay, here's the M-- user documentation, rewritten to follow common GitHub documentation standards (README.md style), including a more professional tone (while still acknowledging the language's inherent absurdity), proper Markdown formatting, and clear sections:

# M-- Programming Language

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-failing-red.svg)](https://example.com/build) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-WTFPL-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.wtfpl.net/) [![Sanity](https://img.shields.io/badge/sanity-questionable-yellow.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionable_Sanity)

## Overview

M-- is an esoteric programming language designed to be deliberately challenging and frustrating to use.  It draws inspiration from languages like Malbolge, but without the self-modifying code (making it *slightly* more manageable).  M-- features pointer-based memory manipulation, indirect addressing, limited control flow, and optional memory volatility.  This language is *not* intended for practical use; it's an exercise in masochism and a test of your debugging skills (or lack thereof).

## Features (or Anti-Features)

*   **Pointer-Based Memory:** No variables, just a 64KB block of memory accessed indirectly through 2-byte pointers.
*   **Indirect Addressing:**  All memory access is through pointers, often leading to chains of pointers (pointers to pointers to pointers...).
*   **Limited Control Flow:**  `goto` is the *only* control flow mechanism (and it's relative).  No loops or `if` statements in the traditional sense.
*   **Symbolic Instructions:**  Single-character instructions (no keywords).
*   **Memory Volatility:**  Memory locations can *randomly* change their values (configurable).
*   **Error Codes:**  A rudimentary system of error codes allows for limited conditional execution.
*   **"Special" .mmm Files:**  Files with a specific header can contain encrypted code, custom volatility settings, and "side effects" (e.g., deleting files, playing sounds).
* **No Debugger**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6+

### Installation

There's no installation *per se*. Just download the `mmm.py` file.  That's the interpreter.

### Running Programs

```bash
python mmm.py <filename.mmm>

Language Reference
Memory Model

M-- operates on a single, contiguous block of 65,536 bytes (64KB) of memory. Memory is addressed using 2-byte (16-bit) pointers, which are interpreted in little-endian byte order. All memory access is indirect: you always work with pointers to memory locations, not the values directly.

Instruction Set
Instruction	Description	Arguments	Example	Notes
^	Add (indirect)	addr1 addr2 dest	^ 0000 0002 0004	Adds the values pointed to by addr1 and addr2. Stores the result (truncated to one byte) at the location pointed to by dest.
*	Multiply (Indirect)	addr1 addr2 dest	* 0010 0012 0014	Multiplies the values pointed to by addr1 and addr2. Stores the result (truncated to one byte) at the location pointed to by dest.
>	Goto (relative)	offset	> 5 , > -3	Jumps offset lines forward (positive offset) or backward (negative offset).
!	Print (indirect)	addr	! 0006	Prints the character whose ASCII value is stored at the location pointed to by addr.
<	Input (indirect)	addr	< 0008	Reads a single character from standard input and stores its ASCII value at the location pointed to by addr. Blocks until input is available.
#	Set Memory (direct)	addr value	# 0010 0005	Sets the 2-byte value at memory location addr to value (little-endian).
@	Halt	None	@	Terminates program execution.
?	Conditional Goto (relative, based on error code)	error_code offset	? 0 10, ? 2 -5	Jumps offset lines if the current error code matches error_code.

Note: All addresses are hexadecimal.

Error Codes
Code	Description
0	No error
1	Out-of-bounds memory access
2	Invalid instruction
3	I/O error
"Special" .mmm Files

"Special" .mmm files provide a way to extend the language's (already considerable) capacity for chaos. They are identified by a magic header and can contain encrypted code, custom volatility settings, and arbitrary "side effects."

File Structure:

Magic Header: \xDE\xAD\xBE\xEF\xCA\xFE\xBA\xBE (8 bytes)

Encrypted Data: (Variable length)

Decrypted Content:

Code: UTF-8 encoded M-- code (variable length).

Separator: Eight null bytes (\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00).

Volatility Rate: 4-byte little-endian unsigned integer, scaled by 10000 (e.g., 1000 represents 0.1 or 10%).

Volatility Seed: 4-byte little-endian unsigned integer.

Side Effects: A sequence of single-byte codes representing side effects (variable length).

Checksum: 4-byte little-endian unsigned integer (CRC32 of the decrypted code, volatility settings, and side effects).

Encryption:

The encrypted data is XOR-encrypted using a key derived from:

The length of the filename.

The current system time in milliseconds (at the time of file loading).

The sum of the ASCII values of the operating system's reported username.

Side Effects:

Code	Description
0x01	Print a random insult to the console.
0x02	Attempt to delete a random file in the current directory. USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION!
0x03	Briefly flash the screen red (Windows only).
0x04	Play a short, annoying sound (Windows only).
0x05	Reverse the order of lines of code
0xFF	Terminate the interpreter immediately.

Creating Special Files:

Use the create_special_mmm() function provided in mmm.py to create special .mmm files. This function handles the encryption, checksum calculation, and file formatting. Do not attempt to create these files manually unless you enjoy pain.

# Example: Create a special file with high volatility and a file deletion side effect.
create_special_mmm("dangerous.mmm", "^ 0000 0002 0004\n@\n# 0000 0001\n# 0002 0002\n#0004 0000", 8000, 42, [0x02])

WARNING: Special files with side effects like 0x02 can be destructive. Run them in a sandboxed environment and back up your data!
